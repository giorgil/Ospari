Ospari
======
**Ospari is a free and open source PHP based blogging software that can use Ghost themes.**  Ospari is developed and maintained by @wrahim.
This is the first release with very basic, but solid features to show, that we can parse themes, which are created with Handlebars.js. <a href="http://blog.ospari.org">Demo</a> 
Visit <a href="http://www.ospari.org">Ospari.org</a> for details and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Ospari">@Ospari</a> on Twitter for updates.

File upload and tagging are currently not supported. We would enable tagging and file upload in next version very soon. 

##Getting started

0. Copy Ospari to a directory of your choice
1. Create a MySQL database
2. Rename core/application.config.php-dist to application.config.php
3. Enter database name, password and username
4. Open your browser, enter your blog URL and press enter.   

##Directory Structure
We have chosen to use an unusual directory structure for Ospari. The core application actually doesn’t belong to the public folder. We have put everything into the public folder to make the installation for the “normal users” very easy. With this directory structure you can also install Ospari in a subdirectory. 

We would remove vender packages in the next releases, but we would still provide a single package for the end users.
